REPORT

 Contrast was checked with WebAim Contrast Checker using the green(0, 128, 0) background and black text. Test failed and Contrast Ratio was 4.08:1. Changed to lightsteelblue(176, 196, 222).

 When navigating with the keyboard only the web page will tab through the nav links, but skips over all the main content and some information cannot be read. The tab key will stop at the audio player, but it has no description when hovering over it with a screen reader so there is no way to tell what it is for. None of the page links or the links in the list cannot be selected with the enter/return key.
